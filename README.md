Data Access Layer
-----------------

A simple abstraction of data access. Simple, feature-rich, clean and hopefully efficent :)

Simplicity
----------

No dynamics, simple and no obscure command execution.

Feature-rich
------------

Lazy loading, unit of Work, change tracking, identity map, multiple resultsets, custom mappings
(all on request - soon to come)

Clean
-----

Based on clean-code principles and SOLID principles (I tried!!) :)

Efficient
---------

I donÂ´t know yet.
