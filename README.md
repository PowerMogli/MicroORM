RabbitDB
========

A simple abstraction of data access. Simple, feature-rich, clean and hopefully efficent :)

Simple
----------

No dynamics, simple and no obscure command execution. 
If used by convention - no attributes are needed.

Features
------------

Change tracking, identity map, multiple resultsets, custom mappings
(all on request - soon to come).
Seperate `Entity` class to inherit from to use without using within `DbSession`.

Clean
-----

Based on clean-code principles and SOLID principles.

Efficient
---------

I donÂ´t know yet.
