RabbitDB
========

A simple abstraction of data access. Simple, feature-rich, clean and hopefully efficent. 
Works like to conjure a white rabbit out of a hat  :)

Simple
----------
No dynamics, simple and no obscure command execution. 
If used by convention - no attributes are needed.

Clean
-----
Based on clean-code and SOLID principles.
